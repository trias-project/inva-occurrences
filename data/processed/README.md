Two files for two publications :

* MI_OccurrenceCore.csv is the occurrence dataset from the hydrobiology Unit. It includes an entire collection with both indigenous/introduced species. It is too heavy to be stored in this folder as csv but has been shared with WeTransfer.

* Zoo_exotic.csv is the occurrence dataset with only exotic species compiled within a lot of databases. This is not the best way to publish (fusion of data sources) but the only way 
to have all our exotic data published in the right time. The strategy is to publish these sources datasets (all data, not only exotic records) independently but it will be a slow process(+ remove this records from the 'invasive' fusion publication in the same time to avoid data duplication).
