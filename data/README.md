* Raw data can not be shared.
* The hydrobiology unit macro invertebrates processed data (entire collection to be published, including exotic taxa) is the heavy and can be shard with WeTransfer.
* The file 'data/processed/fusion_exotic_animals.csv' (tab separated) is the 'fusion' (all our exotic animal taxa amongst all our databases). DatasetName is used for the GBIF dataset reference so the 'source database' of each entry is undertaken with the term 'CollectionCode'.
* Any technical change can be done very fast (do not be scared to tell me to change whatever should be). 
* Data cleaning is done with an Rmd workflow (but in SQL), that also generates a report (basis for me to 'defend' the publication project to the collection manager).
