# DEMNA-occurrences

Data publication DEMNA
ATM : files are ready, waiting green light from DEMNA for the 2 publications :

* one -MI- is the collection of macro invertebrate data of the hydrobiology unit 
which should be published **in its entirety**. 

* the second is a **fusion** of all exotic taxa (and only exotic taxa) amongst all our databases. This one will be implemented before the end of june.

## 'MI' files

are the files linked to the publication of the Hydrobiology Unit at DEMNA. They accepted to publish the entire content of the database, with most of the exotic species datas in a 'Macro invertebrates collection publication' . Exotic species spoted in this dataset : 2088 records for 32 taxas (among 137.000 records of 466 taxa).

### Status : Ready, still waiting the formal publicaiton green light from the unit manager (12/06).


## "Exotic animals" ;

This is the core file for the publication of exotic animals data from DEMNA. This way of publishing will not be maintened in the very long term but to fit with june deadline, we have to aggregate exotic taxa records from many databases (that would each need a lot of work to be published individually) and focus on their cleaning/preparation.

-Based on unified checklist taxa (more sources for first update before june 30)
- 6145 records of 45 Taxa

### Status : ALso all work done, waiting for DEMNA managers validation with 2 weeks delay...
