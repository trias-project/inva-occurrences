Data publication DEMNA
ATM : files are ready, waiting green light from DEMNA for the 2 publications. So datasets are stored here, with respective preparation files (Rmd).

## 'MI' files

are the files linked to the publication of the Hydrobiology Unit at DEMNA. They accepted to publish the entire content of the database, with most of the exotic species datas in a 'Macro invertebrates collection publication' . Exotic species spoted in this dataset : 2088 records for 32 taxas (among 141.000 records of 466 taxa).

### Status : Ready, still waiting the formal publicaiton green light from the unit manager (12/06).


## "DEMNA excotics" ;

This is the core file for the publication of exotic animals data from DEMNA. This way of publishing will not be maintened in the very long term but to fit with june deadline, we have to aggregate exotic taxa records from many databases (that would each need a lot of work to be published individually) and focus on their cleaning/preparation.

-Based on unified checklist taxa (more sources for first update before june 30)
- 6147 records of 45 Taxa

### Status : ALso all work done, waiting for validation with 2 weeks delay...
