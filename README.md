# DEMNA-occurrences

Data publication DEMNA

## "MI" FILES ;

Are linked to first step for the publication of the 'AQUABIO' database. This database will be published in its integrality so exotic species will not be included into 'Exotic Animals in Wallonia' publication. MI is one of the 3 collections of the database that will have it's own GBIF publication (with fishes and macrophytes, after validation of the procedure the 2 others will be prepared quickly). 

Target publication = end of April 2019.

## "Fauna_Taxo" ;

It undertakes all animal taxa presents in DEMNA's exploitable databases (Natagora, AQUABIO, and other databases not to include are already removed). Should only concern animals & shrooms.
* Tax = raw encoding (might include some surprises)
* Taxprio= name for usage (unify synonyms or misspelings together).
* Taxo_id should be attributed to each distinct taxprio. But the count do not match with the count of distinct taxprio...

## "DEMNA excotics" ;

List of exotic species (internal to DEMNA : not complete enough). It should includes animals only. The full version is added in a second file, just in case.
* 'Prioritaire' refers to species included in the Union concern list.


### 'format eel'
Describes the structure under which we aggregate our differents databases to have a 'zoological fusion'.
